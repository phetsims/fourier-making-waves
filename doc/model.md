# Fourier: Making Waves - model description

@author Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.)

This document is a high-level description of the model used in PhET's _Fourier: Making Waves_ simulation.
It's assumed that the reader has some basic knowledge of Fourier Series.

## Mathematical symbols:

* A = amplitude
* A<sub>n</sub> = amplitude of the n<sup>th</sup> harmonic
* f = frequency, in Hz
* F = function of
* λ = wavelength, in meters
* k = wave number
* L = string length, if this were a plucked string, in meters
* n = harmonic number, order, or mode
* π = pi
* σ = Gaussian wave packet width, in radians/meter
* t = time, in milliseconds
* T = period, in milliseconds
* ω = omega, angular frequency, in radians
* x = position in space along L, in meters

## Terminology

* harmonic order, or order
