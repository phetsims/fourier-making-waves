# Fourier: Making Waves - model description

@author Chris Malley (PixelZoom, Inc.)

This document is a high-level description of the model used in PhET's _Fourier: Making Waves_ simulation.
It's assumed that the reader has some basic knowledge of Fourier Series.

## Mathematical symbols:

* A = amplitude
* A<sub>n</sub> = amplitude of nth harmonic
* f = function of time (or space, etc.)
* F = function of frequency
* λ = lambda, wavelength
* k = wave number
* L = "string" length (if this were a plucked string)
* n = mode, order, or harmonic number
* π = pi
* σ = sigma, width of the gaussian packet (dx)
* t = time
* T = sampling period, or period of the 1st harmonic
* ω = omega, angular frequency
* x = position in space along L

## Terminology

* harmonic order, or order
