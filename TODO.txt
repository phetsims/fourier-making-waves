## Common

AxisDescription and Properties of that type have been a constant pain. Get rid of it?
Use yAxisDescriptionProperty in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode?
Fold WaveformChartNode into FMWChartNode, rename WaveformChart to FMWChart?
Can SumChart be used by WavePacketSumChart?
Move visibleProperty for charts into view?
Factor out XZoomHandler and YZoomHandler, use composition to add zoom feature to charts?

## Discrete screen

## Wave Game screen

## Wave Packet screen

FEATURE: WavePacketSumChart.finiteWaveformEnvelopeDataSetProperty, see updateEnvelope in D2CSumView.js
FEATURE: Wavelength/Period tools

create CanvasBarPlot and CanvasAreaPlot, for use in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode

Amplitude chart:
Use AxisDescription for the y axis

WavePacketComponentsChart and WavePacketSumPlot do not use AxisDescription for y-axis, but yAxisDescriptionProperty
is required by their superclass WaveformChart.

## PhET-iO

Do a basic instrumentation pass
