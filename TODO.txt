TODO.txt for fourier-making-waves

## Common

Create FMWChart that corresponds to what FMWChartNode handles
Generalize SumChart and SumChartNode to handle multiple FourierSeries
xZoomButtonGroup is duplicated - move to base class?
Move handling of yAxisDescriptionProperty and autoScaleProperty from SumChartNode to FMWChartNode

## Discrete screen

Reuse Vector2 instances for data sets in FourierSeries (new Vector2) to prevent pause due to GC
Infinite Harmonics feature, see Preset.java

## Wave Game screen

Hide zero-amplitude sliders
Set range of #sliders spinner
Randomly reveal zero-amplitude sliders when spinner changes
Don't evaluate the guess until all sliders have been released
Eliminate WaveGameLevel adapterGuessFourierSeries and adapterAnswerFourierSeries by making charts mutable?

## PhET-iO

Do a basic instrumentation pass
