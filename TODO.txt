TODO.txt for fourier-making-waves

## Common

Add yAxisAutoScaleRangeProperty for all of WaveformChart subclasses in Wave Packet screen
Use yAxisDescriptionProperty in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode, then extend WaveformChartNode
Fold WaveformChartNode into FMWChartNode, rename WaveformChart to FMWChart
Can SumChart be used by WavePacketSumChart?

## Discrete screen

## Wave Game screen

# Wave Packet screen

Java version uses FourierSeries to compute waveforms for components and sum. Should WavePacketFourierSeries extend
FourierSeries? Or should it be a different optimized class that doesn't rely on Harmonic?

Amplitude chart:
Use AxisDescription for the y axis
Use WavePacket.getContinuousWaveformDataSet for infinite components and "Continuous Waveform" checkbox

Component LinePlots: see update in D2CComponentsView.java
Sum LinePlot: see addFourierSeriesPlot in D2CSumView.js
Waveform Envelope: see updateEnvelope in D2CAmplitudesView.java and D2CSumView.js

## PhET-iO

Do a basic instrumentation pass
