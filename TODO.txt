TODO.txt for fourier-making-waves

## Discrete screen

Reuse Vector2 instances for data sets in FourierSeries (new Vector2)

Infinite Harmonics feature, see Preset.java

## Wave Game screen

See GameManager.java.
There are 2 Fourier series (userSeries & randomSeries) and we compare them.
Model:
* The number of non-zero harmonics will be fixed for levels 1-4, and randomly generated (5â€¦11) for level 5.
* Based on the number of non-zero harmonics for a challenge, specific harmonics are randomly selected, and
  random non-zero amplitudes for those harmonics are set. See GameManager newGame.
* The number of zero-amplitude harmonics is also randomly selected, and additional zero-amplitude harmonics (sliders)
  are chosen at random as needed.
* Random generation has no knowledge of previously-generated challenges.
* A challenge is successfully completed when the user has released all sliders AND the amplitudes that the user has
  set are within 0.01 of the randomly-generate amplitudes. See GameManager AMPLITUDE_STEP.
