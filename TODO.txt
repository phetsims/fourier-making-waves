# Discrete screen

#25 all data sets must have the same number of points
Initial, resettable positions for measurement tools
Move chart model out of HarmonicsChart.js
Always compute at least one full cycle of the lowest-order harmonic, so that we know the max for auto scale
Dynamically optimize number of points in dataSets
Auto Scale checkbox
Infinite Harmonics checkbox
Highlight & thicken harmonic plot on pointer-over of amplitude slider or measurement tool (how does this work with multi-touch?)
