## Common

Add yAxisAutoScaleRangeProperty for all of WaveformChart subclasses in Wave Packet screen
Use yAxisDescriptionProperty in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode, then extend WaveformChartNode
Fold WaveformChartNode into FMWChartNode, rename WaveformChart to FMWChart
Can SumChart be used by WavePacketSumChart?

## Discrete screen

## Wave Game screen

# Wave Packet screen

Amplitude chart:
Use AxisDescription for the y axis

I used a different approach for gridLines and ticks in the Components & Sum charts, only putting them at max/min of
the y-axis range. This adds less clutter to busy charts, and clearly shows the amplitude range. Run this past AR.

WavePacketComponentsChart and WavePacketSumPlot do not use AxisDescription for y-axis, but yAxisDescriptionProperty
is required by their superclass WaveformChart.

Sum plot (finite components): see addFourierSeriesPlot in D2CSumView.js
Sum plot (infinite components): ??
Waveform Envelope: see updateEnvelope in D2CAmplitudesView.java and D2CSumView.js

## PhET-iO

Do a basic instrumentation pass
