TODO.txt for fourier-making-waves

Add a query parameter to test/reproduce specific challenges.

Optimize to prevent collapsed charts from updating. Ask team if it's appropriate, worth it.

Replace {Property} xAxisTickLabelFormatProperty in model with {function} xAxisLabelFormatter in view.

Factor out XAxisHandler and YAxisHandler to handle zoom (and auto scaling?), use composition to these features?

Rename WaveformChartNode, make WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode extends WaveformChartNode,
  WavePacketAmplitudesChart extends WaveformChart

WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode: use AxisDescription for the y axis? is it OK to override setYAxis?

AxisDescription and Properties of that type have been a constant pain. Get rid of it?

WavePacketComponentsChart and WavePacketSumPlot do not use AxisDescription for y-axis, but yAxisDescriptionProperty
  is required by their superclass WaveformChart.

create CanvasBarPlot and CanvasAreaPlot, for use in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode
