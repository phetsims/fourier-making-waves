TODO.txt for fourier-making-waves

AxisDescription and Properties of that type have been a constant pain. Get rid of it?

WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode: use AxisDescription for the y axis? is it OK to override setYAxis?

WavePacketComponentsChart and WavePacketSumPlot do not use AxisDescription for y-axis, but yAxisDescriptionProperty
  is required by their superclass WaveformChart.

Rename WaveformChartNode, make WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode extends WaveformChartNode

Factor out XZoomHandler and YZoomHandler, use composition to add zoom feature to charts?

create CanvasBarPlot and CanvasAreaPlot, for use in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode
