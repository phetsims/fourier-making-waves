## Common

Add yAxisAutoScaleRangeProperty for all of WaveformChart subclasses in Wave Packet screen
Use yAxisDescriptionProperty in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode, then extend WaveformChartNode
Fold WaveformChartNode into FMWChartNode, rename WaveformChart to FMWChart
Can SumChart be used by WavePacketSumChart?

## Discrete screen

## Wave Game screen

# Wave Packet screen

Amplitude chart:
Use AxisDescription for the y axis
Use WavePacket.getContinuousWaveformDataSet for infinite components and "Continuous Waveform" checkbox

I used a different approach for gridLines and ticks in the Components chart, only putting them at max/min of
the y-axis range. This adds less clutter to a very busy chart, and clearly shows the amplitude range. Run this
past AR.

Sum LinePlot: see addFourierSeriesPlot in D2CSumView.js
Waveform Envelope: see updateEnvelope in D2CAmplitudesView.java and D2CSumView.js

## PhET-iO

Do a basic instrumentation pass
