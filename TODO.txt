TODO.txt for fourier-making-waves

## Discrete screen

Move chart model out of HarmonicsChartNode.js:
* Move {Property.<Array.<Vector2>>} sumDataSetProperty and the logic for computing it from HarmonicsChartNode to DiscreteChartsModel
* Add {Array.<Property.<Vector2>>} harmonicDataSetProperties and logic that sets them to DiscreteChartsModel

Always compute at least one full cycle of the lowest-order harmonic, so that we know the max for auto scale
Dynamically optimize number of points in dataSets
Auto Scale checkbox
Infinite Harmonics checkbox

Too many params in constructors:
* LengthToolNode 10
* PeriodClockNode 7
* PeriodToolNode 7
* WavelengthToolNode 7
* MeasurementToolsLayoutBox 6

## GitHub issues

#25 CT: all data sets must have the same number of points
#31 Harmonic plot emphasis #31
#33 CT: Cannot read property 'y' of undefined type:automated-testing
#39 Measurement Tools: initial positions, resettable positions, drag bounds
#40 Discrete equation positions are incorrect with ?stringTest=long
