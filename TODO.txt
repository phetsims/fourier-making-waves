## Discrete screen

Move chart model out of HarmonicsChartNode.js:
* Move {Property.<Array.<Vector2>>} sumDataSetProperty and the logic for computing it from HarmonicsChartNode to DiscreteChartsModel
* Add {Array.<Property.<Vector2>>} harmonicDataSetProperties and logic that sets them to DiscreteChartsModel

Always compute at least one full cycle of the lowest-order harmonic, so that we know the max for auto scale
Dynamically optimize number of points in dataSets
Auto Scale checkbox
Infinite Harmonics checkbox
Factor out DragListener to share between all Measurement Tools

## GitHub issues

#25 CT: all data sets must have the same number of points
#31 Harmonic plot emphasis #31
#33 CT: Cannot read property 'y' of undefined type:automated-testing
