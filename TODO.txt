TODO.txt for fourier-making-waves

## Discrete screen

Reuse Vector2 instances for data sets in FourierSeries (new Vector2)
Reuse Range instances in HarmonicsChart, SumChart, DiscreteChartNode (new Range)

Always compute at least one full cycle of the lowest-order harmonic, so that we know the max for auto scale
Dynamically optimize number of points in dataSets
Auto Scale checkbox
Infinite Harmonics checkbox
