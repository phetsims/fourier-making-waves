## Common

Use yAxisDescriptionProperty in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode, then extend WaveformChartNode

Combine FMWChartNode and WaveformChartNode, use for all charts, except Amplitudes in Discrete & Wave Game.
OR
Keep FMWChartNode bamboo only, rename WaveformChartNode to DomainChartNode to handle multiple domains

Amplitude chart:
y axis scale jitters as you adjust Wave Packet Center k0
Is center working correctly, in HTML5 and Java versions?
How to color the bars?
Should I be using AxisDescription for the y axis, as elsewhere?
Use WavePacket.getContinuousWaveformDataSet for infinite components and "Continuous Waveform" checkbox
Create a new plot type that fills in the area under the plot, for infinite components.

Amplitude BarPlots: see addBarPlots in D2CAmplitudesView.java
Component LinePlots: see update in D2CComponentsView.java
Sum LinePlot: see addFourierSeriesPlot in D2CSumView.js
Continuous Waveform: see addContinuousPlot in D2CAmplitudesView.java and D2CSumView.js
Waveform Envelope: see updateEnvelope in D2CAmplitudesView.java and D2CSumView.js
