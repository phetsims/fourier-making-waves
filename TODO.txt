Duplication in ComponentSpacingControl, WavePacketCenterControl, WavePacketKWidthControl, WavePacketXWidthControl
Duplication in ComponentSpacingSlider, WavePacketCenterSlider, WavePacketKWidthSlider, WavePacketXWidthSlider
Brute-force tick marks in ComponentSpacingSlider, WavePacketCenterSlider, WavePacketKWidthSlider

DESIGN:
I'm not sure the symbols and units are correct.
Sliders are not long enough to get to all values.
Do we need keypad to enter values associated with sliders?
Do we really need 2 sliders for Wave Packet Width, or could we replace the bottom slider?
If we have 2 sliders for Wave Packet Width, dragging one needs to disable the other.
k1=, k0=, etc. seems incorrect
The 2 sliders for Wave Packet Width aren't the width. Width = 2 * kWidth.
