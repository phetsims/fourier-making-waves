TODO.txt for fourier-making-waves

Rename domainProperty to xDomainProperty throughout

Optimize to prevent collapsed charts from updating. Ask team if it's appropriate, worth it.

Factor out XAxisHandler and YAxisHandler to handle axis scaling, use composition for these features?

Make WavePacketAmplitudesChart extend DomainChart, WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode extend DomainChartNode?

WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode: use AxisDescription for the y axis? Is it OK to override setYAxis?

AxisDescription and Properties of that type have been a constant pain. Get rid of it?

WavePacketComponentsChart and WavePacketSumPlot do not use AxisDescription for y-axis, but yAxisDescriptionProperty
  is required by their superclass DomainChart.

create CanvasBarPlot and CanvasAreaPlot, for use in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode
