TODO.txt for fourier-making-waves

Replace xAxisDescriptionProperty and yAxisDescriptionProperty with AxisHandler
* handle axis scaling
* 4 different strategies (fix, zoom, auto-scale to description, auto-scale to peak

Make WavePacketAmplitudesChart extend DomainChart, WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode extend DomainChartNode?

WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode: use AxisDescription for the y axis? Is it OK to override setYAxis?

AxisDescription and Properties of that type have been a constant pain. Get rid of it?

WavePacketComponentsChart and WavePacketSumPlot do not use AxisDescription for y-axis, but yAxisDescriptionProperty
  is required by their superclass DomainChart.

create CanvasBarPlot and CanvasAreaPlot, for use in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode
