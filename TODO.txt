## Discrete screen

Migrate chart model from HarmonicsChartNode to DiscreteChartsModel:
* Add {Array.<Property.<Vector2>>} harmonicDataSetProperties and logic that sets them
* Move {Property.<Array.<Vector2>>} sumDataSetProperty and the logic for computing it

Always compute at least one full cycle of the lowest-order harmonic, so that we know the max for auto scale
Dynamically optimize number of points in dataSets
Auto Scale checkbox
Infinite Harmonics checkbox

## GitHub issues

#25 CT: all data sets must have the same number of points
#33 CT: Cannot read property 'y' of undefined
