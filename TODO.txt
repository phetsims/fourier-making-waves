TODO.txt for fourier-making-waves

Rename WaveformChartNode, make WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode extends WaveformChartNode,
  WavePacketAmplitudesChart extends WaveformChart

WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode: use AxisDescription for the y axis? is it OK to override setYAxis?

AxisDescription and Properties of that type have been a constant pain. Get rid of it?

WavePacketComponentsChart and WavePacketSumPlot do not use AxisDescription for y-axis, but yAxisDescriptionProperty
  is required by their superclass WaveformChart.

Factor out XZoomHandler and YZoomHandler, use composition to add zoom feature to charts?

create CanvasBarPlot and CanvasAreaPlot, for use in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode
