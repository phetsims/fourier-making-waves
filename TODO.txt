## Common

AxisDescription and Properties of that type have been a constant pain. Get rid of it?
Add yAxisAutoScaleRangeProperty for all of WaveformChart subclasses in Wave Packet screen
Use yAxisDescriptionProperty in WavePacketAmplitudesChartNode, then extend WaveformChartNode
Fold WaveformChartNode into FMWChartNode, rename WaveformChart to FMWChart
Can SumChart be used by WavePacketSumChart?

## Discrete screen

## Wave Game screen

## Wave Packet screen

FEATURE: Sum plot (infinite components), see addContinuousPlot in D2CSumView.js
FEATURE: Sum Waveform Envelope, see updateEnvelope in D2CSumView.js
FEATURE: Wavelength/Period tools

Amplitude chart:
Use AxisDescription for the y axis

WavePacketComponentsChart and WavePacketSumPlot do not use AxisDescription for y-axis, but yAxisDescriptionProperty
is required by their superclass WaveformChart.

## PhET-iO

Do a basic instrumentation pass
