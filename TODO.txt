TODO.txt for fourier-making-waves

## Common

Factor out YAxisDescriptions
Move AxisDescription to common/model/
Generalize SumChart and SumChartNode to handle multiple FourierSeries
xZoomButtonGroup is duplicated - move to base class?

## Discrete screen

Reuse Vector2 instances for data sets in FourierSeries (new Vector2)
Infinite Harmonics feature, see Preset.java

## Wave Game screen

Don't evaluate the guess until all sliders have been released
Implement WaveGameChallenge.isSimilar
Eliminate WaveGameLevel adapterGuessFourierSeries and adapterAnswerFourierSeries by making charts mutable?
Don't show guess sum when amplitude is zero
See GameManager.java, newGame creates a challenge, AMPLITUDE_STEP (0.01) is how close the guess must be to the answer.

## PhET-iO

Do a basic instrumentation pass
